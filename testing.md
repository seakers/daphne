## Daphne
1. Try the following questions:
    * What do you think of this design?
    * Why does design ${design_id} have this science benefit?
    * How does ${design_id} satisfy ${subobjective}?
    * What is the ${engineer_instrument_parameter} of ${engineer_instrument}?
    * Explain the stakeholder ${engineer_stakeholder} science benefit for this design.
    * Show me a timeline of missions [from ${historian_space_agency}] which measure ${historian_measurement}
    * When was mission ${historian_mission} launched?
    * Which orbit is the most typical for ${historian_technology}?
    * Which instruments [from ${historian_space_agency}] can measure ${historian_measurement} [between ${year} and ${year}]?
    * What are the driving features?
2. Activate Diversifier and test it sends suggestions
1. Activate Suggestions and test it sends suggestions
